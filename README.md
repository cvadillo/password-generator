# Password Generator Starter Code

Tried to modify this starter code so that I could successfully create a random password with the following requirements.

1. 8-128 characters
2. Ability to choose between Uppercase, Lowercase, Numbers and Symbols.
3. Generate a truly random password based on the parameters.

I was able to modify the HTML and incorporate the elements necessary to take user input and create it into variables within my Javascript program.

Those values were then taken as parameters that could be confirmed and then used to generate the password. 

I also created an onClick event to figure out when the user submitted their password parameters.

If the length element is not selected, the user will get an alert, even with a default of 8, the user must select it.

If any of the password parameters are left unchecked, the user will get an alert.

The password is generated by checking the boolean values of the password parameters, if True, a string with random characters with those parameters will be created. The string will then be randomized and a final password will be assigned to the user.

Check out the image of the deployed app below!
